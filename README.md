# Pyglet Cube Rotation

## What is this

This is a simple application (like a hello world!) based on the code posted on a [question asked in 2013 on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16263727/3d-cube-didnt-show-correctly-writen-by-pyglet) by [jing](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2304837/jing).

Their code is based on [Jeremiah's](https://www.3dgep.com/author/jeremiah/) article written in 2012 about [Rendering Primitives with OpenGL](https://www.3dgep.com/rendering-primitives-with-opengl/) in C++.

I'm just cleaning the code, making it more updated and clear in order to help others to know how to start writing a pyglet project.
